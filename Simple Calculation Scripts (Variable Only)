// Calculate the difference
// TODO: Change "Text1" and "Text2" to whichever fields need to be calculated
event.value = this.getField("Text1").value - this.getField("Text2").value;\

// Calculate the quotient
// TODO: Change "Text1" and "Text2" to whichever fields need to be calculated
event.value = this.getField("Text1").value / this.getField("Text2").value;
